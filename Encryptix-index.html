      Encryptix is an encryption consultancy for veterinary clinics and animal shelters, created by <strong>Bradley, Sean, Vitalina, and Eoghan</strong> as part of their IT3 Group Project supervised by <strong>Hristo Trifonov</strong>. We focus on practical ways to secure medical records, appointment data, imaging, and everyday communications in small animal practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website highlights four main encryption concepts: symmetric, asymmetric, hashing, and hybrid encryption. Each one is demonstrated in a simple, visual format that helps visitors see how encryption can protect real veterinary workflows rather than just reading about abstract theory.

        Encryptix works with veterinary clinics and animal shelters to map where patient and client data lives, how it moves between systems, and where encryption should be applied. We translate technical concepts into clear actions that fit real clinical workflows and record keeping obligations.

        Encryptix is a student project developed by third year IT and Cybersecurity students at MTU. The project focuses on demonstrating how modern encryption techniques can be used in real veterinary settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        We look at common scenarios like sharing lab results, sending referral notes, backing up clinical databases, and working between reception, consult rooms, and remote devices. The consultancy angle is to show what a clinic or shelter could actually do next.

        Our Services page features four encryption demos that represent key concepts in modern cybersecurity. 
        Each one shows how data can be encrypted, decrypted, or hashed to ensure information stays private and tamper-proof.

        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> These demos are for educational use only. They are simplified visualisations 
        that demonstrate encryption principles but are not suitable for securing real data.
