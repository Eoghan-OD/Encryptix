    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Encryptix is a cybersecurity consultancy focused on helping veterinary clinics strengthen their data protection and communication security through practical encryption. 
      We design simple, cost-effective solutions that fit existing clinic systems without disrupting daily workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our work covers implementing secure backups, encrypting sensitive files, improving email safety, and delivering clear, hands-on training to clinic staff. 
      We also maintain interactive encryption demos and backend systems that show how different cryptographic methods can protect patient and client data.

      Try our browser based demos on the Services page. They show symmetric, asymmetric, hashing, and hybrid ideas in a friendly way that maps to clinic tasks like sharing X ray notes or exporting reports.

      These are learning tools, not production crypto. We use them to explain why proper keys, backups, and access rules matter.
