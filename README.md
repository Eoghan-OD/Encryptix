# Encryptix Cybersecurity Consultancy

### IT3 Group Project Repository

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **Encryptix**, a specialised cybersecurity consultancy created as part of the IT3 Group Project. This repository contains the complete source code for the Encryptix website, including all encryption demonstrations, scripts, and supporting documentation.

## About Encryptix

Encryptix focuses exclusively on strengthening cybersecurity for **veterinary clinics** and **animal shelters**. These organisations routinely manage sensitive information such as client data, payment details, and detailed medical records but often lack dedicated IT security resources. This makes them vulnerable to ransomware, data breaches, and unauthorised access.

The consultancy was developed to provide clear, practical encryption support informed by the research, background analysis, and threat modelling covered in the group report.

Our mission is to make encryption **accessible, practical, and easy to adopt** for smaller organisations in the veterinary and animal welfare sector.

## Who We Target

Encryptix works specifically with:

### Veterinary Clinics

Clinics store medical histories, client information, card payment details, and diagnostic data. Strong encryption helps them meet GDPR obligations and protects sensitive systems from external attacks.

### Animal Rescue Shelters

Shelters handle adoption forms, volunteer details, donation information, and internal welfare documentation. Encryption allows them to protect this data even when working with small teams and limited budgets.

Both sectors rely increasingly on digital workflows, and Encryptix bridges the gap by offering tailored cybersecurity solutions informed by real clinical and operational constraints.

## What Encryptix Provides

Our services reflect the consultancy objectives and implementation plan outlined in the project report, including:

### Encryption Services

Encryptix supports the deployment of:

* **Symmetric encryption** for local storage and device protection (e.g., AES, BitLocker examples)
* **Asymmetric encryption** for secure communication between clinics and partner organisations
* **Hybrid encryption**, balancing performance with secure key exchange
* **Hashing mechanisms** (SHA-256) for password and record integrity checks

These concepts are demonstrated interactively on the website so that clients can see how each method works in practice.

### Training and Awareness

Encryptix provides structured cybersecurity training, focusing on:

* Encryption fundamentals
* Key management
* GDPR Article 32 security expectations
* Recognising threats
* Reducing human error and misconfiguration
* Responding to potential breaches

This training is based on the frameworks and guidance developed in the awareness and compliance sections of the report.

### Measuring Success

Encryptix evaluates its effectiveness using the measurable outcomes defined in the project report, including:

* A target of **ninety percent encryption coverage** for sensitive data
* A **forty percent increase** in staff cybersecurity awareness after training
* Fully functional encryption demonstrations
* A minimum **eighty percent client satisfaction rating**

These metrics are used to validate the consultancy’s impact.

## Website Overview

The Encryptix website is designed as both an educational resource and a proof of concept. It includes:

* A homepage tailored to veterinary clinics and animal shelters
* Four interactive encryption demos (symmetric, asymmetric, hashing, hybrid)
* A real file encryption tool using AES-GCM
* A services section explaining consultancy offerings
* A team page introducing the project members
* A consistent design and branding style across all pages

All demonstrations complement the encryption concepts defined in the research and technical sections of the report.
