# Encryptix Cybersecurity Consultancy

### IT3 Group Project Repository

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **Encryptix**, a cybersecurity consultancy created as part of the IT3 Group Project. This repository contains the full website source code and encryption demonstrations .

## About Encryptix

Encryptix specialises in delivering practical encryption solutions and security awareness training to veterinary clinics and animal shelters. These organisations frequently manage sensitive client data, financial information, and detailed animal medical records without the benefit of a dedicated cybersecurity team. This leaves them vulnerable to data breaches, ransomware, and unauthorised access, as outlined in our report’s introduction and background research sections .

Our aim is to make reliable encryption accessible, understandable, and easy to implement for smaller organisations in the veterinary and animal welfare sector.

## Who We Target

Encryptix works exclusively with:

* **Veterinary clinics**, which store client details, payment records, and medical histories that require encryption to remain GDPR compliant.
* **Animal rescue shelters**, which handle adopter information, volunteer details, donation records, and sensitive animal welfare documentation.

These organisations rely increasingly on digital systems but often lack the resources to implement strong security controls. Encryptix bridges this gap by providing tailored encryption solutions and staff training informed by our research and compliance analysis .

## What Encryptix Provides

Our consultancy services are shaped directly by the findings in the “Consultancy Goals”, “Awareness and Training Outline”, and GDPR compliance sections of the report .

### Encryption Services

We implement encryption solutions suited to veterinary clinics and shelters, including:

* **Symmetric encryption** for local data and storage (e.g., AES through BitLocker).
* **Asymmetric encryption** for secure communication (e.g., OpenSSL-generated key pairs).
* **Hybrid encryption** to balance secure key exchange with fast data encryption.
* **Hashing tools** such as SHA-256 for integrity verification.

These tools are introduced throughout the website so clients can see how each method works in practice.

### Training & Awareness

Encryptix provides structured training programmes to help staff:

* Understand encryption fundamentals
* Manage encryption keys safely
* Maintain GDPR Article 32 compliance
* Reduce risks caused by human error
* Respond appropriately to potential breaches

Training is based on the frameworks and examples included in the report’s awareness and compliance sections .

### Measurable Success

The consultancy’s effectiveness is measured using the metrics defined in our report , such as:

* Achieving ninety percent encryption coverage for sensitive data
* Improving staff awareness by at least forty percent after training
* Ensuring demos and practical implementations function correctly
* Maintaining at least eighty percent client satisfaction

These metrics guide development and validation across the project.

## Website Overview

The website in this repository is designed to present Encryptix’s services and demonstrate encryption concepts in a clear, accessible manner. As described in the implementation section of the report , the site includes:

* A refined homepage tailored to vets and shelters
* A demonstration hub with symmetric and asymmetric encryption examples
* Interactive file encryption tools
* A “Meet the Team” section
* A consistent, professional design aligned with our consultancy branding

The demos reflect the encryption concepts defined in the research sections of the report.
