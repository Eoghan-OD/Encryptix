        <!-- Case Study 1 -->
        <div class="case-card reveal">
            <h3>Symmetric Encryption in a Veterinary Clinic</h3>
            <p>
                A mid-sized veterinary clinic stored X-rays, blood test results and medical histories on an unencrypted external drive,
                creating a GDPR Article 32 compliance issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                Encryptix implemented AES-256 encryption through BitLocker, generated secure recovery keys and trained staff
                on proper key management. The clinic now has fully encrypted data at rest with no disruption to workflow.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Case Study 2 -->
        <div class="case-card reveal">
            <h3>Asymmetric Encryption for Secure Referrals</h3>
            <p>
                A veterinary practice shared sensitive referral documents with a specialist hospital using unencrypted email,
                leaving communication vulnerable to interception.
            </p>
            <p>
                Encryptix deployed TLS 1.3 using OpenSSL, created RSA key pairs and enforced encrypted transmission for all outgoing referrals.
                Communications are now secure, private and GDPR compliant.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Case Study 3 -->
        <div class="case-card reveal">
            <h3>Hashing to Protect Staff Credentials</h3>
            <p>
                An animal shelter stored staff passwords in plain text within a shared spreadsheet, posing an immediate security risk.
            </p>
            <p>
                Encryptix replaced this with SHA-256 hashing and unique salts, removing all readable passwords from the system
                and greatly improving security resilience.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Case Study 4 (Hybrid Encryption) -->
        <div class="case-card reveal">
            <h3>Hybrid Encryption for Secure Data Backups</h3>
            <p>
                A regional animal shelter stored weekly database backups containing adoption records,
                vaccination details and payment information on a cloud service without any form of encryption.
            </p>
            <p>
                Encryptix implemented a hybrid encryption system using AES-256 for fast data encryption and RSA-2048
                for secure key exchange. Automated scripts were set up to encrypt each backup before upload,
                ensuring both speed and strong protection.
                The shelter now benefits from fully encrypted, tamper-resistant cloud backups.
